## Overview

**KeyFortify** is a security-focused Python application designed to provide measurable, audit-ready password strength analysis using real-world attack modeling.

Unlike common password checkers that provide superficial scores, KeyFortify performs:

- Quantitative entropy analysis  
- Realistic crack-time simulation  
- Threat scenario modeling  
- Privacy-preserving breach detection  
- Key Derivation Function (KDF) benchmarking  

This project demonstrates applied cryptography, secure software engineering, performance modeling, and production-grade Python packaging.

---

## Problem Statement

In modern cybersecurity environments:

- 90%+ of data breaches involve compromised credentials  
- Traditional password policies create false security  
- GPU clusters can break predictable passwords in minutes  
- Organizations lack measurable password security metrics  
- Compliance frameworks require audit evidence  

KeyFortify addresses these gaps using reproducible, data-driven analysis.

## Core Architecture

### Entropy Modeling

Hybrid approach combining:

- Heuristic analysis (zxcvbn-style modeling)
- Mathematical keyspace estimation
- Pattern detection
- Dictionary and substitution awareness

### Crack Time Simulation

Models realistic attacker scenarios:

- Online (rate-limited)
- Online (no rate limit)
- Offline (single GPU)
- Offline (GPU cluster / ASIC)

Formula:

```python
time_to_crack = keyspace / hash_rate
```

Benchmarked against modern hashing standards:

- Argon2id  
- bcrypt  
- scrypt  
- PBKDF2  

---

##  Privacy-Preserving Breach Detection

Implements k-anonymity model:

1. Password is hashed locally (SHA-1)  
2. Only first 5 hash characters are transmitted  
3. Matching suffixes are returned  
4. Comparison occurs locally  

 ✅ Zero exposure of full password  
 ✅ Zero exposure of full hash  
 ✅ Secure-by-design implementation
